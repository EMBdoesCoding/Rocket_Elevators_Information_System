# Description and skills we learned to help develope our web application
 This week we worked as a team to generate our static website into front and backend web application. We split the team up into three key tasks that are used to creat the project, the front end, back end, and the backoffice. We learned how to transfer the static website htmls within Rubby on rails so it can read it. Learned about the asset pipeline which is a framework within rails that assists in with combining JavaScript and CSS into one file for easy and quick webpage loading. We created a login in page for new users and for admins. We created a database and used DBeaver that reads the quotes page and submits that information in the back end and can be also be viewed in the backoffice. We learned how to code in Ruby, use and run mysql, as well as learned how to use web app framework Ruby on Rails.
